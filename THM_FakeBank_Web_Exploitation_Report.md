# 🌐 Web Exploitation Report: FakeBank (TryHackMe)

## **Prepared by: Safayet Ahmed**

### **Executive Summary**

This report documents the successful discovery and exploitation of a critical **Access Control Flaw** and a **Business Logic Vulnerability** on a simulated banking application (`fakebank.thm`). The goal was to demonstrate unauthorized access to restricted features and transfer funds without authentication.

| Assessment Focus | Tools Used | Vulnerability Found | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Web Application Penetration Testing | **Gobuster**, Web Browser | **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)** / Access Control Bypass | Unauthorized modification of financial data (fund transfer). |

---

### **1. Scope and Target**

* **Target:** `http://fakebank.thm/`
* **Objective:** Gain unauthorized access to the fund transfer feature and successfully transfer funds to a controlled account.

### **2. Methodology: Reconnaissance and Discovery**

The assessment began with reconnaissance to identify hidden pages or directories not linked from the public interface.

1.  **Directory Brute-Forcing:** The **Gobuster** tool was used with a common directory wordlist against the target URL.
2.  **Key Finding:** Gobuster identified the existence of the secret path: `/bank-transfer` (Status: 200).

### **3. Exploitation and Proof of Concept (PoC)**

1.  **Access Control Bypass:** The `/bank-transfer` URL was loaded directly in the browser without requiring authentication.
2.  **Exploitation Details:** The fund transfer form was used to execute an unauthorized transaction from account `2276` to the attacker's account (`8881`) for `2000`.
3.  **Proof:** The transaction was successful, and the **Flag** confirmed the successful exploit.

### **4. Mitigation / Lessons Learned**

* **Implement Proper Access Controls:** Restrict access to the `/bank-transfer` directory to only authenticated and authorized users.
* **Stronger Business Logic Checks:** The server must always verify that the "Transfer From" account belongs to the currently logged-in user.
